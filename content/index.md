title: About

I graduated from Yale with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a concentration in Computer Science in May 2019. At Yale, I conducted NLP research under the supervision of Professor Dragomir Radev in the [Language, Information, and Learning at Yale (LILY) Lab](https://yale-lily.github.io/).

After graduation, I spent some years working on technical AI safety and alignment research. I co-led a project at the [AI Safety Camp](https://aisafety.camp) that produced the first empirical demonstrations of a new kind of robustness failure, [[goal-misgeneralization|goal misgeneralization]]. I also completed a summer fellowship at the [Center on Long-term Risk](https://longtermrisk.org), where I sought to [[understanding-agency|understand takeaways from Dennett's intentional stance and the human brain itself]] for thinking about agency in the context of AI safety.

During that time, I was also practicing meditation and seeking the end of suffering. After finding what I was looking for, my motivation and focus shifted to working directly on reducing the suffering of others. Recently, I have been working with the [Organisation for the Prevention of Intense Suffering (OPIS)](https://www.preventsuffering.org) on their [suffering quantification project](https://www.preventsuffering.org/metrics/) while looking for full-time opportunities where I can apply my background and skills to projects and initiatives that reduce suffering most effectively.
