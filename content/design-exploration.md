# Typography & Color Testing

This page is for exploring different design options.

## Typography Examples

### Serif vs Sans-Serif

**Current (Sans-serif):** The default Quartz uses Source Sans Pro - modern, clean, readable.

**Serif option:** Like TurnTrout uses EB Garamond - literary, classic, elegant.

### Sample Content

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. **Bold text looks like this** and _italic text looks like this_.

Here's a paragraph with some inline `code` and a [link to somewhere](https://example.com).

## Math & Code

Math rendering: $E = mc^2$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$

```python
def example_function():
    """This is how code looks"""
    return "Hello, World!"
```

## Lists

- First item
- Second item with **bold**
- Third item with _emphasis_

1. Numbered item
2. Another numbered item
3. Third numbered item

## Callout Examples

> [!note]
> This is a note callout - for general information

> [!tip]
> This is a tip callout - for helpful suggestions

> [!warning]
> This is a warning callout - for important cautions

> [!abstract]
> This is an abstract callout - for summaries

## Block Quote

> "This is what a regular blockquote looks like. It's often used for quotes or highlighting text."
>
> â€” Someone Important

## Different Heading Levels

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

## Color Schemes

We can test different color schemes by modifying `quartz.config.ts`.

Current colors:

- Light mode: Soft grays and blues
- Dark mode: Will configure

Potential approaches:

1. **Monochrome minimalist** - Blacks, whites, grays only
2. **Accent color** - Mostly neutral + one accent color
3. **Catppuccin** (like TurnTrout) - Pastel color palette
4. **Gruvbox** - Warm, retro colors
5. **Nord** - Cool, nordic-inspired
6. **Custom** - Build our own
