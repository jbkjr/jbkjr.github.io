# Claude Context: Jack Koch's Personal Website

## Project Overview

Personal website and blog for Jack Koch, rebuilt from Jekyll to Quartz v4.5.2 static site generator.

- **Purpose**: Personal blog/website with custom features
- **Tech Stack**: Quartz (TypeScript/Node.js), hosted on GitHub Pages
- **Learning Context**: This project is also for learning effective Claude collaboration

## Current State (as of 2025-10-29)

### Branch Structure

- `master` - Old Jekyll site (preserved, original content source)
- `quartz-rebuild` - ✅ NEW Quartz setup (current working branch)

### What's Done

- ✅ Quartz v4.5.2 installed and configured
- ✅ Basic configuration (site title, baseUrl, footer links)
- ✅ Test homepage created (`content/index.md`)
- ✅ Local dev server working (`npx quartz build --serve` on port 8080)
- ✅ Development tooling configured (Prettier, ESLint, pre-commit hook)
- ✅ Typography customization: Open Sans applied for headers and body text
- ✅ Font Preference Finder tool created (ELO rating + characteristic tracking)
- ✅ Fixed Quartz bug: font names with spaces now properly URL-encoded
- ✅ Design exploration page created for testing typography changes
- ✅ **Blog migration complete**: All 11 posts migrated from master branch
  - Flat structure: `content/posts/{slug}.md` (no year folders, no date prefixes)
  - Clean URLs: `/posts/{slug}` (e.g., `/posts/welcome`)
  - Jekyll frontmatter cleaned up (removed `permalink` fields, kept `title`, `date`, `tags`)
  - Added `aliases` to each post for backward compatibility with old Jekyll URLs
  - Removed Jekyll image syntax (`{:class="img-responsive"}`)
  - All 11 referenced images migrated to `content/images/`
- ✅ **URL backward compatibility**: Old Jekyll URLs redirect to new flat URLs via AliasRedirects plugin
- ✅ **Explorer improvements**: Sorts posts by date (newest first), folders collapsed by default
- ✅ **Fixed footnote rendering**: Added inline text before footnote markers to fix markdown parsing
- ✅ **Fixed Quartz popover bug**: Footnote previews now show correct content (popover IDs include hash)
- ✅ **Tag system redesign**: Comprehensive 13-tag taxonomy for semantic coherence and graph view utility
  - Removed redundant tags (merged alignment/existential-safety into ai-safety)
  - Created clear clustering: umbrella tag `ai`, technical tags (nlp, language-models, etc.), thematic tags
  - Removed overly broad `philosophy` tag for accuracy
  - Tags create meaningful connections between related posts
- ✅ **Explorer UX improvements**: Empty folder triangle fix
  - Folders with no visible children (after filtering) no longer show expand/collapse triangle
  - Clean appearance for posts folder that hides individual post pages
- ✅ **Listing page simplification**: Minimal, scannable design
  - Removed tag display from listing page (tags accessible via graph view and individual posts)
  - Clean 2-column grid: date | title
  - Optimized for chronological browsing with only 10 posts
- ✅ **Content cleanup**: Deleted outdated welcome.md post
- ✅ Committed: "Initial Quartz setup" (89ac7b6)

### What's Next

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
- [ ] Further theme customization (colors, layout)
- [ ] Replace test content with real homepage content
- [ ] Add About page
- [ ] Consider Explorer sidebar styling refinements (optional)

### URL Migration (Backward Compatibility) ✅ COMPLETE

**Requirement**: All existing URLs from the old Jekyll site must redirect to the new Quartz URLs to maintain SEO and existing links.

**Old Jekyll URL format**: `/posts/YYYY/MM/permalink_slug/`

**New Quartz URL format**: `/posts/slug` (flat structure, clean URLs)

**URL Mapping** (Old → New):

```
/posts/2018/06/need_ml_safety_researchers/ → /posts/need-ml-safety-researchers
/posts/2018/10/fastai_openai_transformer/ → /posts/fastai-openai-transformer
/posts/2018/12/rick_and_morty/ → /posts/rick-and-morty
/posts/2018/12/elmo_sempar/ → /posts/elmo-sempar
/posts/2019/01/unsupervised_pretraining_comparison/ → /posts/unsupervised-pretraining-comparison
/posts/2020/10/better_terminology_for_ai_x_risks/ → /posts/better-x-risk-terminology
/posts/2020/11/getting-started-spinning-up/ → /posts/getting-started-spinning-up
/posts/2020/12/mapping_conceptual_territory_AI_safety_alignment/ → /posts/mapping-conceptual-territory
/posts/2024/05/why_i_am_no_longer_ai_safety/ → /posts/why-i-am-no-longer-ai-safety
/posts/2024/06/suffering_is_not_pain/ → /posts/suffering-is-not-pain
```

Note: The outdated `welcome.md` post was deleted during the Quartz rebuild.

**Implementation**: ✅ Using Quartz's built-in `aliases` frontmatter field with AliasRedirects plugin. Each post has an `aliases` array pointing to its old Jekyll URL. The plugin generates SEO-friendly HTML redirect pages with meta refresh and canonical links.

**File Organization**: Posts are stored flat in `content/posts/` with clean filenames (no date prefixes). Explorer sorts posts chronologically by date metadata (newest first), providing visual organization without folder hierarchy.

## Tag System Design

### Final Taxonomy (13 Tags)

**Design Philosophy**: Concise, semantically coherent tags that create meaningful connections between posts for graph view utility. Tags should be accurate and specific rather than exhaustive.

**Tag Structure**:

- **Umbrella tag**: `ai` (9 posts) - Connects all AI-related work
- **Technical tags**:
  - `nlp` (4 posts) - Natural language processing posts
  - `language-models` (3 posts) - Transformer/language model specific
  - `transfer-learning` (3 posts) - Transfer learning techniques
  - `semantic-parsing` (2 posts) - Semantic parsing work
  - `reinforcement-learning` (1 post) - RL content
- **AI Safety**: `ai-safety` (5 posts) - Merged from redundant alignment/existential-safety/safety tags
- **Philosophy/Ethics**:
  - `buddhism` (2 posts) - Buddhist concepts and practice
  - `suffering` (2 posts) - Suffering-focused content
- **Meta**:
  - `career` (3 posts) - Career decisions and transitions
  - `cause-prioritization` (1 post) - EA cause area analysis
- **Unique**: `metamodernism` (1 post) - Cultural criticism

**Tag Distribution by Post**:

1. `need-ml-safety-researchers.md`: ai, ai-safety, career
2. `fastai-openai-transformer.md`: ai, nlp, transfer-learning, language-models
3. `rick-and-morty.md`: metamodernism (unique cultural analysis)
4. `elmo-sempar.md`: ai, nlp, transfer-learning, language-models, semantic-parsing
5. `unsupervised-pretraining-comparison.md`: ai, nlp, transfer-learning, language-models, semantic-parsing
6. `better-x-risk-terminology.md`: ai, ai-safety
7. `getting-started-spinning-up.md`: ai, reinforcement-learning, ai-safety, career
8. `mapping-conceptual-territory.md`: ai, ai-safety
9. `why-i-am-no-longer-ai-safety.md`: ai, ai-safety, career, cause-prioritization, suffering, buddhism (bridge between AI safety and suffering reduction)
10. `suffering-is-not-pain.md`: suffering, buddhism

**Design Decisions**:

- **Merged redundant tags**: Combined `alignment`, `existential_safety`, and `safety` into single `ai-safety` tag for conciseness
- **Removed overly broad tags**: Deleted `philosophy` tag as it was too general and inaccurate for the content
- **Clustering strategy**: Technical NLP posts share 3-4 common tags, creating strong graph connections
- **Bridge nodes**: `why-i-am-no-longer-ai-safety.md` connects AI safety cluster to suffering/buddhism cluster with 6 tags
- **Unique content**: `rick-and-morty.md` stands alone with only `metamodernism` tag, reflecting its unique nature

**Graph View Benefits**: The tag structure creates clear thematic clusters while maintaining semantic accuracy. Users can navigate from technical AI work → AI safety → career transitions → suffering reduction as a coherent path.

## Explorer Customizations

### Empty Folder Triangle Fix

**Problem**: The posts folder in Explorer showed a clickable expand/collapse triangle, but clicking it did nothing because a `filterFn` hides individual post pages (only showing the folder itself).

**Solution**: Detect empty folders (folders with no children after filtering) and hide their triangles.

**Implementation**:

**File**: `quartz/components/scripts/explorer.inline.ts`

Added empty folder detection (lines 150-153):

```typescript
// Add class for empty folders (folders with no children after filtering)
if (node.children.length === 0) {
  li.classList.add("empty-folder")
}
```

Modified `toggleFolder` function to prevent toggling empty folders (lines 58-60):

```typescript
// Don't toggle empty folders
const parentLi = folderContainer.closest("li")
if (parentLi?.classList.contains("empty-folder")) return
```

**File**: `quartz/components/styles/explorer.scss`

Added CSS to hide triangle for empty folders (lines 213-218):

```scss
// Hide triangle for empty folders (folders with no children after filtering)
li.empty-folder {
  & > .folder-container > .folder-icon {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Clean UX - folders that have no visible children don't show non-functional expand/collapse affordances. Other folders (like future `projects/` folder) will still have functional triangles.

### Current Explorer Configuration

**File**: `quartz.layout.ts`

Explorer `filterFn` configuration:

```typescript
filterFn: (node) => {
  // Default: hide tags folder
  if (node.slugSegment === "tags") return false
  // Hide individual post pages (but keep the posts folder)
  if (node.data?.slug?.startsWith("posts/") && !node.isFolder) return false
  return true
}
```

**Effect**:

- Hides auto-generated `/tags` folder from Explorer
- Hides individual post pages from Explorer (reduces clutter)
- Keeps the `posts/` folder visible (with empty folder styling)
- Users navigate to posts via chronological listing page or graph view

## Listing Page Design

### Current Design: Minimal & Scannable

**Philosophy**: With only 10 posts, prioritize scannable chronological browsing over rich previews. Tags remain accessible via graph view and individual post pages.

**Layout**: Clean 2-column grid (date | title)

**Files Modified**:

**File**: `quartz/components/PageList.tsx` (lines 73-88)

Simplified rendering - removed tags:

```typescript
return (
  <li class="section-li">
    <div class="section">
      <p class="meta">
        {page.dates && <Date date={getDate(cfg, page)!} locale={cfg.locale} />}
      </p>
      <div class="desc">
        <h3>
          <a href={resolveRelative(fileData.slug!, page.slug!)} class="internal">
            {title}
          </a>
        </h3>
      </div>
    </div>
  </li>
)
```

**File**: `quartz/components/styles/listPage.scss` (lines 9-25)

Simplified grid layout:

```scss
li.section-li {
  margin-bottom: 1em;

  & > .section {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: fit-content(8em) 1fr;

    & > .desc > h3 > a {
      background-color: transparent;
    }

    & .meta {
      margin: 0 1em 0 0;
      opacity: 0.6;
    }
  }
}
```

**Design Evolution**:

1. **Initial**: 3-column grid with tags in separate column → cluttered, spacing issues
2. **Iteration**: 2-column grid with tags inline below titles → "too much purple", hard to distinguish posts from tags
3. **Final**: 2-column grid with just date and title → clean, scannable

**Rationale**: Tag display was visually cluttered on listing page. With small number of posts, chronological scanning is efficient. Tags still accessible via:

- Graph view (thematic exploration)
- Individual post pages (contextual tags)
- Tag index pages (if enabled)

## Working Preferences

### Communication Style

- **Explain design choices** - Walk through options and tradeoffs together
- **Explain non-trivial implementations** - Help user understand what's happening
- **Trivial stuff** - Just proceed without asking
- **Be educational** - User is learning, explanations are valuable

### Development Workflow

1. **Test locally before committing** - Always run `npx quartz build --serve` to verify changes
2. **Explain tools before using** - Especially npm, git, and unfamiliar commands
3. **Collaborative design** - Discuss architecture/design decisions together
4. **Lead on implementation** - Claude can take initiative on coding details

### Git Practices

- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- Stay on `quartz-rebuild` branch until ready to merge
- Don't accidentally work on `master` (it has the old site)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start local dev server (with hot reload)
npx quartz build --serve

# Build once
npx quartz build

# Type checking + format checking
npm run check

# Auto-format code with Prettier
npm run format

# Lint code for quality issues
npm run lint

# Lint and auto-fix issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## Development Tooling

### Code Quality Setup

**Prettier (Auto-formatting)**

- Config: `.prettierrc`
- Runs automatically on every commit via pre-commit hook
- Manual run: `npm run format`
- Settings: 100 char line width, 2-space tabs, no semicolons, trailing commas

**ESLint (Code Linting)**

- Config: `eslint.config.js` (ESLint v9 modern format)
- Only lints custom code (ignores `quartz/` framework directory)
- Catches code quality issues, unused variables, type errors
- Manual run: `npm run lint`
- Auto-fix: `npm run lint:fix`

**Pre-commit Hook**

- Location: `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
- Automatically runs `npm run format` before every commit
- Ensures all committed code is properly formatted
- No action needed - works automatically

### npm Package Management

- All packages install locally to `node_modules/` (no virtual environment needed)
- Dependencies tracked in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`
- Framework code in `quartz/`, custom code outside it
- ESLint configured to only check custom code, not framework

## Typography Configuration

### Current Typography Settings

```typescript
// In quartz.config.ts
typography: {
  header: "Open Sans",
  body: "Open Sans",
  code: "IBM Plex Mono",
}
```

**Design Decision**: Using Open Sans consistently for all text (headers and body) based on scientific preference testing. Code font remains distinct (IBM Plex Mono) for readability.

**Alternative Option**: PT Serif (humanist serif) scored 2nd in preference testing and could be reconsidered in the future.

### Font Preference Finder Tool

Built a comprehensive tool (`font-finder-v2.html`) to scientifically determine font preferences:

**Features**:

- ELO rating system (K-factor: 32, initial rating: 1500) to rank 22 fonts
- Characteristic tracking across 7 dimensions: contrast, x-height, width, weight, formality, readability, style
- 3-phase tournament structure: category exploration → cross-category → finals
- Dynamic font loading (only 2 fonts per matchup for reliable rendering)
- Canvas-based font verification to ensure proper rendering
- Data export to JSON

**Technical Implementation**:

- Loads fonts dynamically per matchup to avoid race conditions
- Uses `document.fonts.ready` API + canvas measurement for verification
- Properly encodes font names for Google Fonts API URLs
- Tracks user characteristic preferences to identify patterns

### Quartz Bug Fix: Font URL Encoding

**Issue**: Font names with spaces (like "Open Sans") weren't being URL-encoded when generating Google Fonts API URLs, causing fonts to fail to load.

**Fix Location**: `quartz/util/theme.ts:88-94`

**Solution**: Added `encodeURIComponent()` to properly encode font names:

```typescript
export function googleFontHref(theme: Theme) {
  const { header, body, code } = theme.typography
  const headerFont = encodeURIComponent(formatFontSpecification("header", header))
  const bodyFont = encodeURIComponent(formatFontSpecification("body", body))
  const codeFont = encodeURIComponent(formatFontSpecification("code", code))

  return `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=${headerFont}&family=${bodyFont}&family=${codeFont}&display=swap`
}
```

**Impact**: This fix benefits any Quartz user using multi-word font names. Before: `"Open Sans"` → broken URL. After: `"Open Sans"` → `"Open%20Sans"` → working URL.

### Quartz Bug Fix: Footnote Popover Caching

**Issue**: When hovering over different footnotes on the same page, all footnotes showed the same popover content (the first footnote's content). This was because popovers were cached by pathname only, without considering the anchor hash.

**Fix Location**: `quartz/components/scripts/popover.inline.ts:42-48`

**Solution**: Include the hash in the popover ID to create unique popovers for each same-page anchor:

```typescript
const targetUrl = new URL(link.href)
const hash = decodeURIComponent(targetUrl.hash)
const hashForId = hash // Save original hash for popover ID
targetUrl.hash = ""
targetUrl.search = ""
// Include hash in popover ID for same-page anchors (like footnotes)
const popoverId = `popover-${link.pathname}${hashForId}`
```

**Impact**: Fixes popover previews for all same-page anchors, particularly important for footnote-heavy content. Each footnote now gets its own cached popover.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Cache Issues

**Problem**: After updating frontmatter (e.g., changing tags), changes don't appear in the built site even after hard refresh or private browsing window.

**Cause**: Quartz caches build artifacts in `.quartz-cache/` directory. Stale cache can prevent updated content from appearing.

**Solution**:

```bash
# Remove the cache directory
rm -rf .quartz-cache

# Kill and restart the dev server
# Find the process: ps aux | grep quartz
# Kill it: kill <PID>
# Restart: npx quartz build --serve
```

**When to suspect cache issues**:

- Source files show correct content, but site shows old content
- Changes to frontmatter (tags, dates, etc.) don't appear
- Hard refresh and private browsing don't help

**Prevention**: The `.quartz-cache` directory is gitignored, so it's safe to delete anytime.

## Useful Context

### Quartz Documentation

- Extensive docs in `docs/` folder
- Online: https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/
- Architecture diagram: `docs/images/quartz transform pipeline.png`

## Questions for User

When unsure about:

- **Design decisions** - Always discuss (colors, layouts, features)
- **Content changes** - Ask before modifying/deleting real content
- **Framework modifications** - Discuss impact and alternatives
- **Deployment** - Confirm GitHub Pages setup approach

## Future Considerations

Ideas to potentially implement later (not immediate priorities):

- **Web-based editor**: Decap CMS or similar for publishing posts from browser (not needed for now, comfortable with vim + git workflow)

## Notes

- This is a personal learning project, not a rush
- User wants to understand the "why" behind decisions
- Customization is encouraged - this should be a unique site
- Public-facing site, so quality matters
