For as long as I can remember, I’ve been curious about the way the world works, especially technology and the tools humans use to understand, interact with, and build our world. From playing endlessly on my grandfather’s iMac as a kid, to running a consumer tech review website and founding a nonprofit to provide underprivileged youth with technology in high school, to my research in machine learning and natural language processing at Yale, I’ve always found technology’s potential to be a source of endless mystery and fascination.

Over the last several years, artificial intelligence and machine learning have become my obsessions. I especially have a passion for thinking about problems in AI alignment. AI, just like any other technology, is neither inherently good nor bad; it is up to us to make sure that the artificially intelligent systems we create do the most good for the most people. More broadly, I love learning about intelligence, consciousness, language, meditation, and related topics. Beyond work, I enjoy spending my time rock climbing, traveling, being outside, reading, and watching movies.
